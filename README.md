Node.js Foundation - Node.js Convergence
=====

This repository is the working repository for the proposed convergence of the
http://github.com/nodejs/io.js and http://github.com/joyent/node projects under
the Node.js Foundation. This repository does not yet replace either of the
node.js or io.js project repositories.

* Node.js - http://github.com/joyent/node
* io.js - http://github.com/nodejs/io.js

Contributions, releases, and contributorship are under the proposed
Governance and Developer Policy for the soon-to-be-launched Node.js
Foundation:

* http://nodejs.org/foundation
* http://github.com/nodejs/dev-policy

This project is operating with the oversight of the Node.js Technical Steering
Committee.

Note: The original io.js README.md is temporarily renamed to iojs_README.md.
